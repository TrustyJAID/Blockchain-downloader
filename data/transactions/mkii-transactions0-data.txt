Wikileaks contact info? [quote author=RHorning link=topic=1735.msg26876#msg26876 date=1291501064]

Basically, bring it on. Let's encourage Wikileaks to use Bitcoins and I'm willing to face any risk or fallout from that act.

No, don't "bringit on".

The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.

I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.

We have the hashes for genesis block through block 74000 hardcoded (compiled) into bitcoin, so there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to automatically download a compressed zipfile of the block database from [i]anywhere[/i],unpack it, verify it, and start running.

The 74000 checkpoint is not enough to protect you, and does nothing if the download is already past 74000. -checkblocks does more, but is still easily defeated. You still must trust the supplier of the zipfile.

uncompressed data using a protocol (bitcoin P2P) that wasn't designed for bulk data transfer.

The data is mostly hashes and keys and signatures that are uncompressible.
