So the 13LB starting point is the first WL wallet. I searched for that and found this one here: 13LBgLZ24X55mr8LqKddy9DusJtba17NCC
the guy who penciled this image is using shorthand for the wallet IDs and transaction hashes obviously
if you look at the wallet page here: https://blockchain.info/en/address/13LBgLZ24X55mr8LqKddy9DusJtba17NCC you will see the first transaction has an id of d1bad82d84b10cf8f42d96f1247ad56b814c1319f427e3df8bd954ad0b6d4bf7
  Transactions sent and received from bitcoin address 13LBgLZ24X55mr8LqKddy9DusJtba17NCC.
that's the one we want
that's a transaction to the 1CxLv42sRbTKP76Ezd5DdBufctzd34wEcR wallet
and he's written it in in the second batch there, see?
so I went to that wallet and checked for a transaction with first few letters of ID d324c and that must be this transaction: d324cd7e090e9b69fef173c272229bf86e1ecb30d816e58fb100d429f38c6583
and that leads to 1pm1o - the third wallet in the chain
is everyone following this so far?
you're not following transactions, you're following wallets
the transactions written above the arrows by the anon is just telling us that x BTC was paid to this wallet
eventually you get to the wallets with the ~800 transactions which probably have the gold
I strongly urge you to do this exercise for yourself - it's doesn't take long
I have to go sorry
I will write this up and include screenshots and upload the doc somewhere
